This starter code is here to show examples of how to use the HW3 code that you
can copy and paste into your homework code if you wish. It is not meant to be a
fill-in-the blank skeleton code, so the structure of your final submission may
differ from this considerably.

Please make sure to update DMUStudent to gain access to the HW3 module.

# Extras
########

# With a typical consumer operating system like Windows, OSX, or Linux, it is nearly impossible to ensure that your function *always* returns within 50ms. Do not worry if you get a few warnings about time exceeded.

# You may wish to call select_action once or twice before submitting it to evaluate to make sure that all parts of the function are precompiled.

# Instead of submitting a select_action function, you can alternatively submit a POMDPs.Solver object that will get 50ms of time to run solve(solver, m) to produce a POMDPs.Policy object that will be used for planning for each grid world.
